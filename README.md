# MRI_demency_CNN

## Installation

pydicom, numpy, pandas, PIL, tensorflow, matplotlib is necessary to run the code. 
There should be no further necessary libraries to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

In this project, we were interesteded in using MRI images of demency and no demency cases to train a CNN for the binary classification 'demency' or 'no demency'. 

## File Descriptions 

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the topic above. 
The image dataset and its pertaining excel files are not available to publish. The excel file contains the demency level denoted as Periventricular White Matter changes.

## Results
The classifier reached a test accuracy of 88%.
